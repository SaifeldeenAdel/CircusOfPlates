All of our actual logic

Some classes i thought of:

- Shape class and subclasses (extends MovableObject)
- Shape Loader, Pool, Factory classes
- Falling and Moving states to handle different movements of shapes (implements Shape State class)
- Clown class to initialise the player and keep score, counting stacks of plates, etc (extends ControllableObject?)
- Levels? How will we implement the level logic (observer?)
